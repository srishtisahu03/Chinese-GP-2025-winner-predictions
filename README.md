# Chinese-GP-2025-winner-predictions

This repository contains a data analysis and prediction model for the 2025 Chinese Grand Prix Formula 1 race. The project uses historical F1 data to build a predictive model that forecasts race outcomes based on various factors including driver performance, track characteristics, and historical results.

## Project Overview

The repository focuses on analyzing Formula 1 racing data to predict the potential winner of the 2025 Chinese Grand Prix. The analysis pipeline includes data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and prediction evaluation.

## Features

- Historical F1 race data analysis
- Driver performance metrics evaluation
- Track-specific performance analysis
- Machine learning model for race outcome predictions
- Visualization of prediction results and key influencing factors

## Tech stacks

- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- GradientBoostingRegressor (amazing for analysis of non-linear relationships)

## Results

The model predicts potential winners for the 2025 Chinese Grand Prix based on historical performance data and current season dynamics. For detailed results and the methodology, please refer to the Jupyter notebook.

## Future work

- Include more granular weather data for improved predictions
- Add team strategy simulation
- Incorporate car development trajectory throughout the season
- Expand the model to predict full race standings

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the prediction model or add more analysis dimensions are welcome! Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
